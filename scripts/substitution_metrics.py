"""Label keystrokes.csv `replace`/`paste` rows along orthogonal axes.

The app logs text changes by shape, not intent: autocorrect, a QuickType tap,
an inline prediction accepted with space, smart punctuation and sentence
capitalization all arrive as identical `shouldChangeTextIn` calls and all come
out as `replace`. iOS exposes no API for the source of a change, so intent is
reconstructed here rather than at capture time - a bad rule is then fixed by
re-running this script instead of re-collecting sessions.

Each substitution row gets four labels instead of the old single enum:

- `substitution_source` - who initiated the change. The only inferred axis;
  `substitution_source_confidence` says how much to trust it.
- `substitution_effect` - what changed. Certain: a pure function of the two
  strings.
- `substitution_outcome` + `revert_latency_ms` - what the user did about it.
  Certain: computed by replaying the session's edit script.
- `substitution_kind` - derived alias reproducing the old flat enum so
  downstream consumers keep working.

`next_delimiter_gap_ms` carries the timing evidence behind the source label so
it ships with the data. Column semantics live in .claude/data-dictionary.md;
the reasoning behind the rules in .claude/decisions/0003-substitution-taxonomy.md.

# Testing the substitution pipeline

For anyone recording a FreeTypeRecorder session and checking what the analysis
makes of it. Recording the app itself: see
[FreeTypeRecorder/README.md](FreeTypeRecorder/README.md).

## 1. What to do during your typing session

**Screen-record the whole session** (the app does this) — the video is the
ground truth your labels get checked against. Then, while typing naturally,
deliberately include each of these, ~5–10 times each:

| Behaviour | How | What it should label as |
|---|---|---|
| Autocorrect | type `teh`, hit space | autocorrect / spelling |
| Bar tap | type `tomo`, tap "tomorrow" in the bar above the keyboard (do some with each hand) | suggestion bar tap / completion |
| Inline prediction | type until grey ghost text appears after your cursor, accept it by hitting space | inline prediction — **most valuable, we have zero confirmed examples** |
| Bar-tap fix | type `teh`, tap "the" in the bar (don't hit space) | known blind spot — labels autocorrect; we want its timing data |
| Case fix | type lowercase `i`, hit space | autocorrect / capitalization |
| Contraction | type `its`, hit space → `it's` | autocorrect / contraction |
| Select + overtype | double-tap a word to select it, type a new word over it | manual overtype |
| Select + delete | double-tap a word, hit backspace | (behaviour count: whole-selection delete) |
| Revert a correction | let autocorrect change a word, then backspace it and retype **exactly** what you originally typed | outcome: reverted_to_original |
| Revert differently | let it correct, delete it, type a different word | outcome: replaced_with_other |
| Leave corrections alone | just keep typing after some corrections | outcome: kept |

Autocorrect must be ON in Settings → General → Keyboard. If a session is
deliberately run with it off, put `ac_off` in the session/file name (`ac_on`
otherwise) — the script warns when the name and the data disagree.

## 2. Running the analysis

Plain `python3`, no packages needed (stdlib only).

```sh
# download your session's keystrokes CSV from Drive into sessions_raw/
# as <session>_keystrokes.csv, then from the repo root:
python3 scripts/substitution_metrics.py sessions_raw/<session>_keystrokes.csv
```

Outputs land in `processed-keystrokes/`, named after your session (nothing
gets overwritten by other sessions):

- `<session>_processed.csv` — every keystroke row plus the labels
  (`substitution_source`, `substitution_effect`, `substitution_outcome`,
  `revert_latency_ms`, `next_delimiter_gap_ms`; column meanings in
  `.claude/data-dictionary.md`)
- `<session>_summary.md` — human-readable counts with definitions inline

Several sessions at once: `python3 scripts/substitution_metrics.py
sessions_raw/*_keystrokes.csv`. A combined machine-readable table:
add `--out combined.csv`.

Tests: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_substitution_metrics.py`

## 3. What to check / send back

1. The `## calibration` line of your `_summary.md`. Expected: `anchored` or
   `anchored_high`. **`global` or `global_conflict` on a session with plenty
   of corrections is a finding** — your device's timing doesn't fit the
   model; send the summary + processed CSV.
2. Compare the labelled rows against your screen recording — especially every
   bar tap and every inline prediction. Any mismatch: note the video
   timestamp and the row's `t_ms`.
3. If the script prints a `replay diverged` warning, that's not your mistake —
   iOS edited text without telling the logger. Note it and send the session.
4. Send back: the raw `_keystrokes.csv`, the screen recording, and your list
   of which behaviours you performed when.

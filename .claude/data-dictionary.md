# Data Dictionary — Keystroke CSV Schema

Canonical column reference for keystroke exports. **Raw** columns are written by the
iOS app (`DataExporter`); **cleaning** columns are appended by
`scripts/clean_keystrokes.py` (rows are never deleted — only flagged).

## Raw columns (iOS export)
| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `participant_first`, `participant_last` | str | Participant name |
| `session_id` | str | Unique session identifier |
| `session_mode` | str | `classic` or `gaussian` |
| `study_session_index` | int | Order of this session within the study design |
| `trial_id` | str | Unique trial identifier |
| `trial_index` | int | Trial number within the session (0–14; 15 trials/session) |
| `event_type` | str | `insert` / `delete` (backspace) |
| `key_label` | str | Key that was hit (a–z, `space`, `delete`) |
| `tap_local_x`, `tap_local_y` | float | Tap position in the hit key's local frame (points) |
| `tap_norm_x`, `tap_norm_y` | float | App-side normalized tap (local / key size) |
| `key_width`, `key_height` | float | Hit key geometry (points) |
| `key_row`, `key_col` | int | Hit key grid position |
| `expected_char` | str | Character the prompt expected here |
| `actual_char` | str | Character actually produced |
| `corrected_char` | str | Char after any correction |
| `is_correct` | int | 1 if actual == expected |
| `previous_key_label` | str | Prior key (for IKI context) |
| `text_before` | str | Field text before this event (empty = trial start) |
| `timestamp_ms` | int | Event time (ms) |
| `inter_key_interval_ms` | float | ms since previous event |

## Cleaning columns (appended by clean_keystrokes.py)
| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tap_norm_x`, `tap_norm_y` | float | **Recomputed** normalized tap (tapLocal / keySize); 0=left/top, 1=right/bottom. Note: appears a second time after the raw pair. |
| `dist_from_target_kw` | float | Distance from tap to the **expected** key rect, in key-widths (0 if inside) |
| `is_outlier` | int | 1 if any flag fired |
| `outlier_flags` | str | Pipe-separated reasons (empty = clean) |
| `is_spatial_outlier` | int | (some variants) 1 if normalized tap outside `[-0.5, 1.5]` |

## Outlier flag values
| Flag | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `spatial` | `tap_norm_x/y` outside `[-0.5, 1.5]` (>½ key-width outside hit key) |
| `far_from_target` | `dist_from_target_kw` > 1.25 (too far to be a neighbor mistap) |
| `iki_low` | `inter_key_interval_ms` < 50 (double-registration) |
| `iki_high` | `inter_key_interval_ms` > 3000 (pause / distraction) |
| `trial_start` | `text_before` == "" (first keystroke of a trial) |
| `delete_event` | `event_type` == "delete" (intentional backspace) |
| `sigma_outlier` | > N std devs from expected key's cluster mean (only with `-s`) |

Filename convention: `<name>_cleaned_t<thr>[_s<sigma>].csv` encodes the cleaning
thresholds used (e.g. `_cleaned_t1.0_s2.5.csv`).

# Data Dictionary — FreeTypeRecorder Session Files

A different app and schema from the TypingResearch export above. Free-typing
sessions have no target word, so they have no correctness columns. One session
directory (`Documents/Sessions/<hand>/<name>-<n>/`) contains:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `keystrokes.csv` | Every text-change event |
| `cursor.csv` | Every caret or selection change |
| `imu.csv` | Device motion |
| `final_text.txt` | The text the participant ended with (UTF-8) |
| `session_meta.json` | Participant, hand, device, and prompt; written at session start |
| `face.mov`, `screen.mov`, `seg_images/` | Video and segmented frames |

The loggers start together, so the CSV streams use a common session-relative
`t_ms` origin and can be joined by nearest timestamp.

## `keystrokes.csv`

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `t_ms` | float | Milliseconds since session start |
| `event_type` | str | `insert`, `delete`, `replace`, or `paste` |
| `replaced_text` | str | Text replaced by this edit; empty for a plain insert |
| `replacement_text` | str | Text inserted by this edit; empty for a delete |
| `range_start` | int | UTF-16 offset where the edit applied |
| `range_length` | int | UTF-16 length replaced |
| `resulting_text_length` | int | Swift character count after the edit, not a UTF-16 length |
| `inter_key_interval_ms` | float | Milliseconds since the previous edit; 0 for the first |
| `selected_length_before` | int | Selection length when the change fired. Non-zero means the user highlighted their own text and typed over it — the system never substitutes into a selection |
| `marked_text_before` | 0/1 | Whether marked text (a pending inline prediction) existed when the change fired |

Rows form a complete edit script. Replay them from an empty string using UTF-16
offsets and compare the result with `final_text.txt`. For each row, the text at
`range_start`/`range_length` should equal `replaced_text`; a mismatch indicates
desynchronization and the session should be excluded rather than analyzed.

## `cursor.csv`

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `t_ms` | float | Milliseconds since session start; same origin as the other logs |
| `sel_start` | int | New selection start, or caret position when `sel_length` is 0; UTF-16 |
| `sel_length` | int | New selection length; values greater than 0 mean text is selected |
| `prev_sel_start`, `prev_sel_length` | int | Previous selection, in UTF-16 units |
| `delta_chars` | int | `sel_start - prev_sel_start`; negative means a backward move |
| `caret_x`, `caret_y` | float | Snapped caret origin in text-view points; empty if unavailable |
| `caret_h` | float | Caret height in points; empty if unavailable |
| `touch_x`, `touch_y` | float | Most recent in-app touch in text-view points; empty if unavailable |
| `touch_phase` | str | `began`, `moved`, or `ended`; empty when no touch has been observed |
| `tap_count` | int | UIKit tap count for the latest touch; `2` directly identifies a double tap |
| `touch_age_ms` | float | Milliseconds from the most recent in-app touch to this row |
| `ms_since_last_text_change` | float | Milliseconds since the latest text edit; empty before the first edit |
| `text_length` | int | Current UTF-16 text length |

Empty geometry fields mean unavailable, never zero. `caret_x`/`caret_y` record
where iOS snapped the caret; `touch_x`/`touch_y` record where the finger landed.
Their difference is the caret tap-accuracy signal.

`ms_since_last_text_change` is raw timing rather than a boolean latch. A
same-length autocorrect may not trigger a selection callback, which would leave
a latch stale and mislabel a later deliberate caret move. The timestamp cannot
become stranded and its threshold can be refined offline.

## Derived offline (not columns)

**Cursor `cause`**, derived per row in this priority order:

| Value | Starting rule |
|---|---|
| `typing` | `ms_since_last_text_change < 50`, or `text_length` differs from the previous cursor row |
| `tap` | `touch_phase == "began"` and `touch_age_ms <= 100` |
| `double_tap_selection` | `tap_count == 2` and `sel_length > 0`; directly observed whole-word selection candidate |
| `drag` | `touch_phase == "moved"`; collapse contiguous rows into one episode |
| `keyboard_gesture` | No recent in-app touch and no text change; typically the space-bar trackpad gesture |

**Keystroke substitution labels** — implemented in
`scripts/substitution_metrics.py`, which writes `<session>_processed.csv`. They
are **not** present in the `keystrokes.csv` that uploads to Drive; run the
script on a downloaded session to add them. Rationale for every rule:
`.claude/decisions/0003-substitution-taxonomy.md`.

Apply to `event_type` of both `replace` **and** `paste`. A suggestion tap often
inserts the completion at a collapsed caret (`range_length == 0`, multi-character),
which the shape classifier calls `paste` even though nothing was pasted.

Four orthogonal labels replace the old flat `substitution_kind` enum (kept as a
derived alias):

| Column | Answers | Certainty |
|---|---|---|
| `substitution_source` | who initiated the change | inferred — see `substitution_source_confidence` |
| `substitution_effect` | what changed | certain: pure function of the two strings |
| `substitution_outcome` | what the user did about it | certain: replayed from the edit script |
| `revert_latency_ms` | ms until the user first touched the substituted span | certain; empty when `kept` |
| `next_delimiter_gap_ms` | trailing delimiter gap backing the source label | measured; empty when no delimiter follows within 200 ms |
| `substitution_kind` | legacy alias of source + effect | — |
| `episode_final` | replayed end state of a reverted span (`day → d` deleted, `say` typed ⇒ `say`) | replayed; **reverted rows only** — `kept`/`edited_after` never collapse, their end state is `replacement_text`; empty when the replay diverged before settling |
| `episode_final_trusted` | 1 when `episode_final` is safe to quote, 0 when the region grew past the episode | contaminated regions are detectable by content: they contain a whitespace/punctuation char found in neither `replaced_text` nor `replacement_text` (spacing/typography pairs legitimately carry their own delimiter) |

`substitution_source` priority cascade:

| # | Rule | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `selected_length_before > 0` — the system never substitutes into a selection | `manual_overtype` | certain |
| 2 | Both sides punctuation only (smartQuotes/smartDashes, deterministic insert-time rule) | `smart_typography` | certain |
| 3 | New extends old (`tomo` → `tomorrow`) and trailing gap ≥ 9 ms | `suggestion_bar` | inferred; `grey_zone` when the gap is 7–12 ms |
| 4 | Extends, gap < 9 ms, `marked_text_before == 1` on an insert earlier in the word | `inline_prediction` | grey_zone |
| 5 | Extends, gap < 9 ms, no marked hint | `autocorrect_engine` | grey_zone |
| 6 | Extends, gap undefined | `inline_prediction` | inferred |
| 7 | Old non-empty (corrections of any shape, incl. `i` → `I`: sentence auto-caps pre-shifts the keyboard and never emits a replace) | `autocorrect_engine` | inferred |
| 8 | Fallthrough | `unknown` | — |

The trailing gap is iOS's own latency between committing a replacement and
committing the following delimiter: ~13 ms when the system auto-appends the
space after a bar tap, ~5 ms when a typed delimiter triggered the change.
Machine timing, not human. It applies **only** to completions; corrections
sit in the high group too and would mislabel.

The 9 ms / 7–12 ms values are fallback constants: the split is re-derived
**per session** from anchor rows whose timing group is known without timing
(low: in-rhythm spelling fixes, IKI < 250 ms; high: capitalization/
contraction/punctuation corrections) — see ADR 0004. The session summary
records `gap_threshold_ms`, `gap_calibration` (`anchored` / `anchored_high` /
`anchored_low` / `otsu` / `global` / `global_conflict`), and
`gap_low_anchors` / `gap_high_anchors`.

`substitution_effect`, first match wins (multi-effect rows take the earlier
label): `capitalization` (same ignoring case), `punctuation` (both sides
punctuation, or non-empty whitespace rewritten as punctuation — the
double-space period arrives as ` ` → `. `), `contraction` (stripping
apostrophes/quotes from new gives old), `completion` (extends), `spacing`
(equal ignoring whitespace), `spelling` (both non-empty), `other`.

`substitution_outcome`, from replaying the session's edit script and tracking
each substituted span: `kept` (untouched to end of session),
`reverted_to_original` (span deleted and the original text retyped),
`replaced_with_other` (span deleted, different text in its place),
`deleted_entirely` (span deleted, nothing in its place — only assigned at a
foreign-delimiter close or session end, never by an unrelated mid-session
edit; ADR 0005), `edited_after` (span modified but partly intact). If replay diverges from
`resulting_text_length` on an unmarked row (a real capture gap — iOS edited
text without a delegate callback), outcomes resolved before that point are
kept and the rest stay empty; `kept` is never guessed. While
`marked_text_before == 1`, `resulting_text_length` legitimately includes the
uncommitted marked text and is not treated as divergence.

Legacy `substitution_kind` alias: `manual_overtype`;
`smart_typography` → `smart_punct`; `suggestion_bar` → `quicktype_pick`;
`inline_prediction`; `autocorrect_engine` + `capitalization` → `sentence_caps`;
`autocorrect_engine` + anything else → `autocorrect`; `unknown`.

The script warns when an `ac_off` session contains `autocorrect_engine` rows
(Settings switch not actually flipped) and when an `ac_on` session contains
none (switch silently left off).

## Platform limits

- The offered QuickType candidates cannot be captured. iOS exposes no API for
  them, and ReplayKit hides the system keyboard from `screen.mov`; only accepted
  substitutions are observable.
- Keyboard touches are invisible to the app. Only touches inside the app window
  populate `touch_*`, which is also what makes space-bar gestures distinguishable.
